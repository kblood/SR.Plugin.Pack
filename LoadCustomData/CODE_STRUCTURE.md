- ‚úÖ Proper ITEM_[ID]_NAME pattern implementation
- ‚úÖ Prevention of translation overwrites during auto-load

### üîÑ Current Issues Being Addressed

**1. Price Changes Not Showing in Game UI**
- ‚úÖ m_Cost field successfully updated (confirmed in logs)
- ‚úÖ Additional cost fields updated (m_CurrentResearchCost, etc.)
- ‚ùì Investigation needed: Why UI doesn't reflect m_Cost changes
- ‚ùì Potential UI refresh or different display fields issue

**2. Translation Loading Verification**
- ‚úÖ translations.xml loading integrated into auto-load
- ‚ùì Need to test if manual translation edits now work in-game

### üöß Pending Future Improvements

**Command Pattern Implementation** (Phase 3)
```csharp
public interface IPluginCommand
{
    void Execute();
    string Description { get; }
}
```
**Benefits**: Better hotkey organization, improved testability

**Separate Import/Export Actions** (Current Priority)
- Currently both import and export run together
- Need to separate button actions for better user control
- Will prevent unnecessary dual operations

## Current System Architecture

### Service-Based Design
```
LoadCustomDataRefactor.cs (Main Plugin)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AutoLoadService - Handles automatic loading on game start
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CommandService - Manages hotkey commands and execution
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ UINotificationService - Handles user interface messages
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Services/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ItemDataManager - Item import/export with change detection
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ TranslationManager - XML-based translation system
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SpawnCardManager - Enemy/spawn card management
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ FileManager - File I/O operations
```

### Key Features Implemented
- **Game State Detection**: `Manager.Get().GameInProgress` ensures proper loading timing
- **Translation Integration**: Automatic ITEM_[ID]_NAME key pattern support
- **Change Detection**: Only logs and updates items that actually changed
- **XML Support**: All data now uses XML serialization format
- **Enhanced Logging**: Detailed change tracking for debugging
- **Auto-Load Integration**: Translations loaded automatically with items

## Known Issues and Troubleshooting

### Item Price Changes Not Showing in Game
**Issue**: m_Cost field updates successfully (confirmed in logs) but changes don't appear in game UI
**Investigation Status**: Ongoing
**Possible Causes**:
- UI refresh not triggered after data changes
- Game uses different fields for price display
- Need to trigger ItemManager refresh events
**Log Evidence**: "Cost: 300 -> 333" changes detected and applied

### Translation System Integration
**Status**: Working correctly
**Features**:
- XML-based translation loading
- Automatic ITEM_[ID]_NAME pattern support
- Prevention of overwriting manual edits during auto-load
- Integration with game's TextManager.m_FastLanguageLookup

### Build System
**Status**: Working with MSBuild
**Requirements**: Use `build.bat` script instead of `dotnet build`
**Reason**: .NET 3.5 compatibility and game assembly references

## Future Improvements (Phase 3+)

### Enhanced Error Handling
```csharp
public class PluginException : Exception
{
    public ErrorCode Code { get; }
}
```

### Command Pattern Implementation
```csharp
public interface IPluginCommand
{
    void Execute();
    string Description { get; }
}
```

### Data Validation Service
```csharp
public class DataValidationService
{
    public ValidationResult ValidateItem(SerializableItemData item);
}
```

## Usage Guide

### Auto-Loading System
The mod automatically loads items and translations when a game is started:
```csharp
// Auto-load sequence
1. Detect game state with Manager.Get().GameInProgress
2. Load translations.xml (preserves manual edits)
3. Load items.xml with change detection
4. Show success/failure notifications
```

### Manual Import/Export
- **F9**: Import items and translations from XML files
- **F10**: Export items and translations to XML files
- **F11**: Auto-load items and translations (same as game start)

### File Locations
- **Items**: `items.xml` in mod folder
- **Translations**: `translations.xml` in mod folder
- **Spawn Cards**: `spawnCards.xml` in mod folder
- **Icons**: `icons/` folder in mod folder

## Debugging and Logging

### Log Locations
- **Plugin Logs**: Unity console (accessible via F1 in game)
- **Game Logs**: `C:\Modding\SatelliteReign\SatelliteReignWindows_Data\output_log.txt`

### Change Detection Logging
The system logs only items/translations that actually change:
```
ItemDataManager: Item 61 changes detected: Cost: 300 -> 333, Progression: 0.5 -> 0.7
TranslationManager: Updated translation 'ITEM_61_NAME' -> 'Modified Item Name'
```

### Translation System
- Uses game's ITEM_[ID]_NAME and ITEM_[ID]_DESCRIPTION pattern
- Preserves manual translation edits during auto-load
- XML format matches game's internal structure

## Current Limitations

1. **Price Changes**: m_Cost updates don't show in game UI (investigation ongoing)
2. **Import/Export**: Single button triggers both operations (needs separation)
3. **UI Refresh**: May need to trigger ItemManager refresh events

This refactored system provides a clean, maintainable architecture with proper separation of concerns and comprehensive debugging capabilities.
